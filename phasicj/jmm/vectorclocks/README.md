# `phasicj::jmmevents::vectorclocks`

This package enhances the Java Memory Model (JMM) events generated by
`phasicj::jmmevents` with vector clock timestamps. Vector clocks are updated
and synchronized according to the JMM's synchronization rules. This is useful
in detecting reads and writes which the JMM classifies as data races.
